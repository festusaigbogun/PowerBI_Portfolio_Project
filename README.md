## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Subcategory Focus**: Given that Binders have the highest count, consider focusing on marketing and sales efforts to further capitalize on this popular subcategory. You could also explore expanding the range or improving the quality of Binders.

2. **Shipping Mode Efficiency**: Since Standard Class is the most commonly used shipping mode, analyze if there are opportunities to optimize shipping costs or delivery times without compromising service quality. This could help reduce expenses and improve customer satisfaction.

3. **Segment Tailoring**: As the consumer segment is the largest, consider tailoring marketing campaigns and product offerings to better meet the needs and preferences of this segment. This may involve more targeted advertising or specialized products.

4. **Yearly Strategy**: Given the fluctuation in order counts by year, develop a strategy to replicate the success of 2017 and address the issues faced in 2014. Identify the factors that contributed to the peak year and make necessary adjustments.

5. **Return Rate Reduction**: A 2.88% return rate is relatively high. Investigate the reasons behind returns, improve product descriptions, quality, and packaging, and enhance the return process to reduce this rate.

6. **Pricing and Discount Strategy**: Evaluate the pricing and discount strategy for each category. You might consider reducing discounts for Office Supplies, increasing them for Technology, and maintaining a balance for Furniture to optimize profit margins.

7. **Geographic Expansion**: Given that New York City leads in sales and profit, consider expanding marketing efforts in this region. Replicate successful strategies in other top-performing areas like Los Angeles, Seattle, and Philadelphia.

8. **Category Emphasis**: Focus on Technology as it generates the highest sales and profit. For Furniture, explore ways to improve profit margins without compromising sales. For Office Supplies, consider strategies to increase sales even further, since it already has higher profits than Furniture. 

9. **Customer Engagement**: Given that Greg Maxwell is a high-volume spender, consider establishing a loyalty program or offering exclusive incentives to retain and nurture such high-value customers. This can help increase customer retention and lifetime value.
